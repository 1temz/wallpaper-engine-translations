# Wallpaper Engine Translations

This repository hosts the translation files for Wallpaper Engine ( http://store.steampowered.com/app/431960 ) to make collaboration easier.

New strings will be added to [locale/core_en-us.json](https://github.com/Wallpaper-Engine-Team/wallpaper-engine-translations/blob/master/locale/core_en-us.json) and [locale/ui_en-us.json](https://github.com/Wallpaper-Engine-Team/wallpaper-engine-translations/blob/master/locale/ui_en-us.json). They then need to be translated into the other available languages, you should submit those as pull requests.

You can find missing strings by looking at at the [Missing Translations Directory](https://github.com/Wallpaper-Engine-Team/wallpaper-engine-translations/tree/master/missing_translations). The directory is auto-generated and contains a list of all missing translations for all files (if a file is not in that directory, it means it has been translated 100%). Check the [locale/core_en-us.json](https://github.com/Wallpaper-Engine-Team/wallpaper-engine-translations/blob/master/locale/core_en-us.json) and [locale/ui_en-us.json](https://github.com/Wallpaper-Engine-Team/wallpaper-engine-translations/blob/master/locale/ui_en-us.json) respectively to get an overview of the original English strings.

For more information you can check out the translation thread on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/app/431960/discussions/7/215439774876424597/

We use Travis to run validation scripts to ensure the submitted translations are valid JSON files and that special elements like variables and line breaks are not missing from the specific translation strings. If you run into any issues, don't hesitate to ask in the Steam Community discussions or create an issue on Github.
